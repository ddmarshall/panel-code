Python Code
~~~~~~~~~~~

For Python code, we follow the *Style Guide for Python Code*, `PEP
8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__. Code should should
produce no warning when analyzed by
`pycodestyle <https://pycodestyle.pycqa.org/>`__. In addition the code
should produce no messages from `Pylint <https://pylint.org/>`__. These
should be checked before committing code, and most IDEs support these.
Both of these tools are common in most Python installations. They are
also available from `PyPI <https://pypi.org>`__.
