Welcome to pyPC's documentation!
================================

**pyPC** is a Python library for panel method algorithms and select implementations of panel methods for aerodynamic flows.
Panel methods are a technique to solve for flows over bodies where the governing equations can be represented using potential flow theory.
Currently pyPC is focusing on two-dimensional, incompressible flows, but there are plans to expand its capabilities to model a wider variety of flows.

   This project is under development and the API might change between releases.
